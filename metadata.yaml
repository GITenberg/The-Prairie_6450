description: "The Prairie: A Tale (1827) is a novel by James Fenimore Cooper, the\
  \ third novel written by him featuring Natty Bumppo. His fictitious frontier hero\
  \ Bumppo is never called by his name, but is instead referred to as \"the trapper\"\
  \ or \"the old man.\" Chronologically The Prairie is the fifth and final installment\
  \ of the Leatherstocking Tales, though it was published before The Pathfinder (1840)\
  \ and The Deerslayer (1841). It depicts Natty in the final year of his life still\
  \ proving helpful to people in distress on the American frontier. The book frequently\
  \ references characters and events from the two books previously published in the\
  \ Leatherstocking Tales as well as the two which Cooper wouldnâ€™t write for more\
  \ than ten years. Continuity with The Last of the Mohicans is indicated by the appearance\
  \ of the grandson of Duncan and Alice Heyward, as well as the noble Pawnee chief\
  \ Hard Heart, whose name is English for the French nickname for the Delaware, le\
  \ Coeur-dur.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
